                        At Audio Mixing Mastering, we are committed to providing you with high-quality services and ensuring that you are satisfied with the results of your audio mixing and mastering. However, since our services are electronic, non-tangible, and irrevocable, our refund policy has been established to maintain fairness for both our clients and our business.

                    <h2 className="font-THICCCBOI-Medium text-[30px] leading-[40px] font-medium mb-4">Understanding Our Refund Policy</h2>
                    <p className="font-DMSANS font-normal text-base mb-4">
                        We understand that sometimes, despite our best efforts, you might not be fully satisfied with the results. Our goal is to ensure that you are happy with the service you receive. Therefore, we offer the following terms to manage any concerns:

                    <h2 className="font-THICCCBOI-Medium text-[30px] leading-[40px] font-medium mb-4">No Refunds on Completed Orders</h2>
                    <p className="font-DMSANS font-normal text-base mb-4">
                        Once an order has been placed and payment is processed, we <strong>do not issue refunds</strong> for completed services. This is because our services are digital, non-tangible products, and we cannot retrieve or re-sell the audio files or work after the service has been completed.
                    </p>

                    <p className="font-DMSANS font-normal text-base mb-4">
                        In cases where a refund is requested, we <strong>do not issue direct refunds</strong>, but instead, we may issue <strong>credits</strong> for future services. The amount of credit issued is determined by us on a case-by-case basis and will be based on the nature of the request. These credits are valid for <strong>up to 5 days</strong> from the date they are offered. Once the 5-day period has passed, the credits will expire, and no further use of the credits will be allowed.
